In this project we have created a model of food web in the form of animated site.
This project gives us the shortest food chain in the food web by taking input from the user.

We have used DIJKSTRA ALGORITHM to find the shortest path in the food web and used HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT to implement our project.
THANK YOU.
